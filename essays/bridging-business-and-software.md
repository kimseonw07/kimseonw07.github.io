## From Business Questions to Technical Curiosity
I began my academic journey in Business Administration, where I learned how to analyze markets, evaluate strategies, and think about value creation from a high-level perspective. Over time, however, I became increasingly curious about what happens beneath those strategies—specifically, how software systems are designed and built to turn ideas into real products. This curiosity led me to pursue Computer Science alongside business, and eventually sparked my interest in software engineering. For me, software engineering represents the point where abstract business goals meet concrete technical execution.

## Learning Software Engineering as a Beginner
As someone still early in my software engineering journey, I am particularly interested in building strong fundamentals. Writing clean, readable code and understanding core concepts such as data structures, control flow, and version control have become central goals. Rather than rushing toward advanced frameworks, I want to develop habits that scale over time: breaking problems into smaller pieces, reasoning carefully about logic, and learning how to debug effectively. These skills, while technical, also mirror the structured thinking I developed through business case analysis.

## Looking Ahead: Skills and Experiences to Develop
Looking forward, I hope to deepen my understanding of how software systems are designed in real-world environments. I am especially interested in learning more about collaborative development, such as working with Git, conducting code reviews, and communicating technical ideas clearly with others. In the long term, I aim to grow into someone who can bridge the gap between business and engineering—contributing not only code, but also thoughtful perspectives on how technical decisions align with user needs and organizational goals.
